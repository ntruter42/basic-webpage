					Israel has a rich historical and religious background, including Jerusalem's Old City and the Western Wall.
					<!-- Many important biblical events took place in Israel and it's considered to have an emotional effect on tourists who belive in the spiritual significance of the landmarks. -->
					It also has a diverse culture and vibrant nightlife scene in Tel Aviv.
					There are beautiful beaches, landscapes and outdoor activities in the Negev Desert and along the Mediterranean coast.

                    I'd love to learn Spanish because it is very popular around the world and a lot of the places I'd like to visit have Spanish as one of the top 3 most spoken languages.
					Spanish opens up many opportunities to work in Spain, Argentina and Mexico or Latin America.
